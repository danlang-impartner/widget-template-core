# Dynamic forms
    
Microservice that supports dynamic forms.

## Getting Started

When using rider, edit your Default run environment in the run/edit configurations
and add/edit the following variables:


```
ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:8080
```

This is not hard coded in the project as we run this from a docker container, separating
configuration from implementation.
